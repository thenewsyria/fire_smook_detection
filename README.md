# 🌟 Image Classification with CNN 🌟

A deep learning project using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify images into multiple categories. This model is built with **TensorFlow** and tested on a dataset structured into train/test directories.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic resizing and normalization of images.
- **CNN Architecture**: Three convolutional layers with max pooling and dropout.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Upload an image and get predictions with confidence scores.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow >= 2.0
- NumPy
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset Structure
Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:
```
data/
   train/
       class1/
       class2/
       ...
   test/
       class1/
       class2/
       ...
```

---

## 📖 How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Classification-CNN.git
   ```
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Upload your dataset.
   - Train the model by running cells step-by-step.

3. **Test the Model**:
   - Upload an image when prompted.
   - Get predictions and confidence levels.

---

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy**: 85% (or your result after training)
- **Loss**: 0.3 (or your result after training)

---

## 🎨 Model Overview
- **Input Layer**: Images resized to 150x150x3.
- **Conv Layers**: Extract features with increasing filters (32, 64, 128).
- **Pooling Layers**: Down-sample feature maps.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layer with 128 neurons.
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification.
